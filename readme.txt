README

This project aims to develop a mobile phone application on the iOS platform, which can retrieve text from photos and screenshots, and thereby allowing users to search for photos by the text contained. All retrieved text would also be available for users to edit and use elsewhere.

This project has been tested with XCode 8.3 and XCode 9.0, and it is at least compatible with iOS 10 and iOS 11. It is also tested on an iPhone 6s, with both iOS 10 and 11 as the operation system.

This project requires CocoaPods, so "PhotoSearch.xcworkspace" should be run instead of "PhotoSearch.xcodeproj".
